Code
Main class: set up for GUI menu, GUI game board and gameplay
Player class: stores players' names, colors and whether player is human or AI
Click class: used for button actions and placing colors on board
AI class:
  Determines wins and ties
  Chooses moves for AI player(s)
  Method for choosing best moves in best()
    Win if possible
    Block other player from winning next turn if possible
    Create 2 lines of 4 tiles if possible (win next turn)
    Prevent other player from creating 2 lines of 4 tiles
    If none of above apply, evaluate score for each square
      Uses score() method, which employs freq() to evaluate all lines of 5 squares before and after a possible move
      Modified by the play style, which determines prioritization of offensive versus defensive moves
    Choose from the reduced list of moves at random and play it
  Code also included for recursive move prediction, but not used because it is inefficient and slow
